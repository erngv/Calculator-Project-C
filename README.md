# Simple Calculator Project in C

## C Programming Language Practice

This simple calculator computes the following:

Perimeter: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle.

Area: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle.

Volume: Cube, Rectangular Prism, Triangular Pyramid, Sphere.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program allows the user to choose whether they want to calculate the perimeter, area or volume. Once the user has chosen their calculation from a given menu, the program provides the user a sub-menu with the available geometric shapes in the corresponding option.

The program then asks the user for the appropriate measurements needed to perform the calculations, and validates userâ€™s input. Finally, the program prints the result of the calculations to two decimal places and prompts the user to make additional calculations.

The program includes a user defined library with user defined functions.
